# 🍔 Fast Food Giants EDA & Sales Regression

This project explores the sales performance of major fast food chains in the U.S. using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and regression modeling techniques.

## 📈 Overview

We analyze fast food chains by:
- Investigating their revenue and popularity
- Comparing store counts and market presence
- Exploring relationships between revenue and other business factors
- Building a linear regression model to predict annual revenue

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Companies with fewer stores may outperform in revenue
- Average meal prices and store density show interesting correlations
- Some chains achieve high revenue with fewer locations

## 🧪 Techniques Used
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations
- Correlation heatmaps
- Regression modeling using Scikit-learn
- Feature selection with backward elimination
